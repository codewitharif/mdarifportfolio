              Hey there! ðŸŒ§ I'm M Dinesh, a B.Tech Information Technology student passionate about building web applications 
              that solve real-world problems. I've created projects like Aquaswatt for monitoring the usage of water and electricity, 
              with skills in React, Node.js, and Python. I love exploring new technologies, solving DSA problems and working on 
              AI-powered solutions.
